            <p class="mb-5">Researchers from Washington University in St. Louis created a framework public health and clinical scientists can use to <strong>measure the impact of their work in the real world.</strong> In early 2022, the group released <strong>a set of PDF-based tools</strong>, which assist researchers in planning, tracking, and demonstrating the impact of their research. </p>

            <p class="mb-5">As the the school released these new PDFs, it determined it would need an online, interactive edition of the tools to go beyond what static PDFs could do.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-4 mt-12 font-bold text-3xl md:text-4xl">What I did</h2>

            <p class="mb-5">Working closely with the school and a design partner, I developed a web-based application built in WordPress and Vue for the tools.</p>

            <p class="mb-8">In this app, users are able to...</p>

            <p class="mb-5">Additionally, we produced a <strong>beautiful, intuitive redesign</strong> of the Institute of Clinical & Translational Sciences website to complement the new application.</p>


            <h2 class="mb-4 mt-12 font-bold text-3xl md:text-4xl">The outcome</h2>
            <p>Early feedback has been positive, but like any online product, itâ€™s never done. In phase 2, we will be conducting usability studies with those researchers. We plan to iterate on the interface and experience as more researchers use the tools.</p>
